# CRFPindex

Data on the climate-related financial policy index (CRFPI) - comprising the global climate-related financial policies adopted globally and the bindingness of the policy - are provided in this paper for 74 countries from 2000 to 2020. 
The data include the index values from four statistical models used to calculate the composite index as described in D’Orazio, P., & Thole, S. (2022). Climate-related financial policy index: a composite index to compare the engagement in green financial policymaking at the global level. Ecological Indicators, 141, 109065. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109065.
The four alternative statistical approaches were designed to experiment with alternative weighting assumptions and illustrate how sensitive the proposed index is to changes in the steps followed to construct it.
